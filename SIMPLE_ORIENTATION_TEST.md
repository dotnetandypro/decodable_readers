# 🔄 SIMPLE ORIENTATION TEST

## 🎯 **VERY OBVIOUS VISUAL DIFFERENCES**

I've created a super simple version with **VERY OBVIOUS** visual differences so you can immediately see if orientation detection is working:

### **📱 PORTRAIT MODE:**
- **BLUE background** and **BLUE border**
- Header text: **"📱 PORTRAIT MODE - SINGLE PAGE"**
- Content: **"SINGLE PAGE VIEW"** with one white box
- Text inside: **"PAGE CONTENT (Portrait Mode)"**

### **🔄 LANDSCAPE MODE:**
- **RED background** and **RED border**  
- Header text: **"🔄 LANDSCAPE MODE - 2 PAGES SIDE BY SIDE"**
- Content: **"TWO PAGE VIEW - LIKE A BOOK"** with two white boxes
- Text inside: **"LEFT PAGE (Landscape Mode)"** and **"RIGHT PAGE (Landscape Mode)"**

## 🚀 **How to Test:**

1. **Run the app** in Xcode (▶️)
2. **Navigate to any story** (Level 1 → any storybook)
3. **Look for the colors:**
   - **BLUE = Portrait** (1 page)
   - **RED = Landscape** (2 pages)

## 🔍 **What You Should See:**

### **If Orientation Detection Works:**
- **Portrait**: Blue background, single page
- **Rotate to landscape**: Should **IMMEDIATELY** change to red background, two pages
- **Rotate back**: Should **IMMEDIATELY** change back to blue background, single page

### **If Orientation Detection Doesn't Work:**
- You'll always see the same color (blue or red) regardless of rotation
- The layout won't change when you rotate

## 📱 **Debug Information:**

Check **Xcode Console** for these messages:
```
🔄 BUILD: Current orientation = LANDSCAPE
📐 Screen: 844.0 x 390.0
🎨 Building PageView: LANDSCAPE mode
```

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

You should see **IMMEDIATE** and **OBVIOUS** changes:
- **Blue → Red** when rotating to landscape
- **Red → Blue** when rotating to portrait
- **1 page → 2 pages** layout change
- **Clear text indicators** showing the current mode

If you don't see these obvious color and layout changes, then we know the orientation detection isn't working and we need to try a different approach.

**Try it now and tell me what colors you see!** 🔵🔴
